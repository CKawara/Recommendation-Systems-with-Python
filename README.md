# Building various Recommendation Systems with Python

In this repo I intend to ;

* Explore different Data wrangling techniques using the pandas library
* Build an IMDB Top 250 Clone
* Build a content based engine to recommend movies based on movie metadata
* Explore Data mining techniques used in building recommenders


Go through [Intro.md](https://github.com/CKawara/Recommendation-Systems-with-Python/blob/main/Intro.md) for the theoretical explanation of the recommender systems we will build.
